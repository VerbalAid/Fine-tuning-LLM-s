### Fine-tuning Large Language Models

This repository contains materials and code examples from the "Fine-tuning Large Language Models" course by [deeplearning.ai](https://www.deeplearning.ai/). It covers key concepts and practical implementations for fine-tuning large language models with comprehensive examples and demonstrations.

### Course Overview

The course is structured into several segments, each highlighting important aspects of the fine-tuning process:

- **Introduction (2 mins)**: Overview of the course and significance of fine-tuning in modern NLP applications
- **Why Fine-tune (14 mins)**: Detailed discussion on benefits and motivations behind fine-tuning large language models
- **Where Fine-tuning Fits In (15 mins)**: Explains the role of fine-tuning within the broader ML/NLP workflow
- **Instruction Fine-tuning (9 mins)**: Demonstrates instruction-based fine-tuning with practical examples
- **Data Preparation (10 mins)**: Covers steps and best practices for preparing data before fine-tuning
- **Training Process (16 mins)**: Comprehensive look at the fine-tuning process with hands-on examples
- **Evaluation and Iteration (11 mins)**: Discusses evaluation techniques and iteration strategies
- **Considerations on Getting Started (4 mins)**: Advice for newcomers to the field
- **Conclusion (1 min)**: Summary and final thoughts
